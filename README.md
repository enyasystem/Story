# 📚 Story Project

Welcome to the Week-1 Story Project! This project contains a short, original story told across three chapters, each in its own file:

## 📖 Chapters
- `chapter1.txt` – The beginning: setting the stage for hope and uncertainty.
- `chapter2.txt` – The journey: dreams, challenges, and the search for change.
- `chapter3.txt` – The night: reflection, courage, and the promise of a new dawn.

## ✨ How to Use
1. Open each chapter file to read the story in sequence.
2. Feel free to edit or expand the story with your own ideas!

## 📝 Contributing
